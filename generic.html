									<h2>Digital Design/FPGA Intern at Astranis Space Technologies</h2>
									<p>During Summer 2021, I wrote and tested <b>SystemVerilog Modules</b> for <a href ="https://www.astranis.com/" target="_blank">Astranis'</a> RTL team. I met weekly with the team to discuss projects I was working on and troubleshoot any issues that came up.
										One module I wrote was a <b>Push/pull RAM</b> according to <b>AXI-4.</b> This ram would pull data out of the RAM when only when the data was valid and the receiver was ready.
										When testing this design, I <b>developed constrained random tests</b>. Queues of randomized data entered the RAM. I ensured that the design met the specification by testing with back pressure and simultaneous read/write.
										My internship at Astranis exposed me to both design and testing in SystemVerilog for <b>Xilinx FPGAs.</b></p>

									<h2>Cornell Cup Robotics: Member to Electrical Lead</h2>
									<p>I joined <a href="https://cornellcuprobotics.com/" target="_blank">Cornell Cup Robotics</a> during my Sophomore year. As a Senior, I led the Electrical Subteam lead. The team is student run and we build robots.
										When I was a member, I worked on the arms of a robot called C1C0 which is lab assistant similar in size to R2D2.
										First, I developed an <b>interrupt service routine (ISR)</b> to pulse <b>stepper motors</b> in parallel. 
										Moving the motors in parallel (rather than one-by-one) makes the robot look more fluid and life-like.
										Once the ISR was fully tested, I integrated my design with the computer science team. The computer science team sent commands to the arm to tell it to move to a new position. My job was to <b>implement a communication protocol</b> to move the arm to the desired position.
										To do this, I implemented the <b>R2 Protocol</b> on a <b>Jetson to Arduino interface.</b></p>
									
									<p>As the Electrical Team Lead, I acted as a <b>manager to the other students</b> on the team. 
										When someone got stuck, I helped them <b>troubleshoot and debug.</b>
									</p>

									<h2>Peer Advisor For Cornell Engineering College</h2>
									<p>During the Fall 2021 and Fall 2022 semester, I was a <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/advising/peer-advisors" target="_blank">Peer Advisor for Cornell's College of Engineering.</a>
										The transition from high school to Freshmen Year at Cornell is incredibly challenging. My job was to help make that transition a little bit easier.
										I <b>co-taught a class with a professor and another student.</b> We taught Freshmen <b>how to balance school and adjust to life at Cornell</b> away from their parents. We answered any questions they had whether they are academic or not.
										I really enjoyed being a Peer Advisor because I was able to meet people that I wouldn't have met otherwise and tried to impart any wisdom I learned during my time at Cornell.

									<h2>PHYS 2214: Oscillations, Waves, and Quantum Mechanics Teaching Assistant</h2>
									<p>During Spring 2021, I was a teaching assistant for <a href ="https://sce.cornell.edu/courses/roster/phys-2214" target="_blank">Physics 3 at Cornell</a>. Twice a week, I <b>ran the discussion section</b> with a graduate student. 
										Together, we <b>answered students' questions</b> about the material and <b>helped them work through practice problems.</b> We covered topics ranging from <b>sound and light waves to quantum mechanics.</b>
