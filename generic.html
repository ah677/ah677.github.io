									<h2>Digital Design/FPGA Intern at Astranis Space Technologies</h2>
									<p>During Summer 2021, I wrote and tested SystemVerilog Modules for Astranis' RTL team. I met weekly with the team to disucss projects I was working on and troubleshoot any issues that came up.
										One module I wrote was a Push/pull RAM according to AXI-4. This ram would pull data out of the RAM when only when the data was valid and the receiver was ready.
										When testing this design, I developed constrained random tests. Queues of randomized data entered the RAM. I ensured that the desing met the specification by testing with back pressure and simultaneous read/write.
										My internship at Astranis exposed me to both design and testing in SystemVerilog for Xilinx FPGAs.</p>

									<h2>Cornell Cup Robotics: Member to Electrical Lead</h2>
									<p>I joined Cornell Cup Robotics in January of 2021. Today, I am the Electrical Subteam lead. The team is student run and we build robots.
										When I was a member, I worked on the arms of a robot called C1C0 which is lab assistant similar in size to R2D2.
										First, I developed an interrupt service routine (ISR) to pulse stepper motors in parallel. The ISR is called every few microseconds. It interrupts the flow of code execution and pulses any motors that need to be moved. 
										The purpose of this ISR is to move all 6 motors on the arm in parallel, rather than move each of the individually. The ISR makes the robot look more fluid and life-like.
										Once the ISR was fully tested, I intergrated my design with the computer science team. The computer science team sent commands to the arm to tell it to move to a new position. My job was to implement a communicaiton protocol to move the arm to the desired position.
										To do this, I implemented the R2 Protocol. Now that I am Electrical Team Lead, I no longer work on my own projects, but act as a manager to the other students on the team. When someone gets stuck, I help them troubleshoot and debug.

									<h2>Peer Advisor For Cornell Engineering College</h2>
									<p>Since the Fall fo 2021, I have been a Peer Advisor for the College of Engineering.
										The transition from high school to Freshmen Year at Cornell is incredibly challenging. My job is to help make that transition a little bit eaiser.
										I co-teach a class with a professor and other student. We teach Freshmen how to balance school and adjust to life away from their parents. We answer any questions they have whether they are academic or not.
										I really enjoy being a Peer Advisor because I get to meet people that I wouldn't have met otherwise and try to impart any wisdom I have learned during my time at Cornell.

									<h2><a>PHYS 2214: Osciallations, Waves, and Quantum Mechanics</a> Teaching Assistant</h2>
									<p>During Spring 2021, I was a teaching assistant for Physics 3 at Cornell. Twice a week, I ran the discussion section with a graduate student. 
										Together, we answered students' questions about the material and helped them work through practice problems. We covered topics ranging from sound and light waves to quantum mechanics.
