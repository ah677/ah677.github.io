									<h2>01 November 2021</h2>
                                    <p>I wrote this piece for my <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/ENGL/2800" target="_blank">Creative Writing class (ENGL 2800)</a>; it is a retelling of Cinderella.</p>

                                    <h2>Elle by Ariana Haghighi</h2>
									<p>“Elle, show a little respect,” her stepmother scolded, her accent heavier than the basket of wet laundry wrapped around her hip. “It’s all that’s left of your father’s legacy.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“My father’s legacy? How pathetic is it that all he left behind for all his hard work was a dingy cleaning company?” I let that sink in for a moment, always a flare for the dramatic. “No degrees to hang up. Not a cent in his retirement fund.” Reading his will had been a short divergence to her day all those years ago. We rented the apartment and all of the furniture. No watch to give to the eldest son. There was nothing to fight over. Just some documents to sign and shove deep into my backpack before trekking off to AP exams. He gave me all he had: enough love to compensate for two parents. And it was enough, until it wasn’t. You can’t live off of love alone. After his death, all he had left me with was the drive to do better than he did. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“And what about me? Aren’t I part of my father’s legacy too? Shouldn’t I take precedence over this piece of shit? This ‘business’ is barely enough to keep us scraping by, we need to do more than that. What about me, what about my future, my education?” I certainly did not get enough sleep last night, and I’m taking it out on Maria. I don’t have the mental stamina right now to evaluate if taking it out on her is fair or not. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Maria boiled under her uniform, the heat rising to her face. So predictable, never in control of her emotions, easily swayed by the actions and words of others. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“Elle, language. You forget that you're not the only person in this family.” She sent a heated glance towards the kitchen where the twins were undoubtedly eating cereal and watching cartoons before school. If you could even call their excuse of an elementary school a form of education. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A twinge in my gut pulled at me. She had a point of course, but she never seemed to understand mine. If just one of us made it big, we would all be set for life. If I could focus on just school, focus just on getting my education, I could pay for all of the work I missed 6 months after graduating, and then some. I could help send the twins to school. Hell, even Maria could get her degree. But, I won’t bother wasting my breath; I’ve explained it to her enough. She has no intention of leaving poverty, of taking a risk. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Without saying another word, I storm out. I can’t be late for class. And anyways, Henri is waiting, my only real ticket out of here. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>… 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“Elle, I’m sorry. I’ll-I’ll make it up to you. Hey, let’s go shopping.” My tears instantly evaporate. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Oh, this is good. Perfect, actually. 
                                        “Really? You really think a shopping trip will fix everything.” My disappointment turned to anger. Even though he’s overslept and missed our meeting, he still looks elegant and put together in his tailored Brooks Brothers. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Henri composed a flustered response, forever a diplomat, forever the perfect gentleman. “No, no you’re right. I can’t just throw money at you and expect it to fix everything.” Elle could see Henri recede into the decades of boarding schools. Never a call on his birthday, but rather a heaping pile of useless and expensive presents that wouldn’t be touched until it was time to move out for the summer. Not that he ever really looked forward to it, summer I mean. He was just as thoroughly ignored at home. The only real attention he got was from the help-- the chef, the maid, the nanny, the tutor-- and even then it was out of pity. His father seriously considered sending him to summer camp, but he needed to know what the real world was like. He needed the hustle of Manhattan to show him where real men made their money, not at some camp in the middle of Maine. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“No, you know that money doesn’t fix these things. You know better than your father. You can do so much better than him, you just need to learn how.” A small smile crept up on his face. “Maybe a role model could help you.” The smile consumed his face, dimples and all. His golden-brown eyes crinkled with his forehead and it was impossible to not smile back. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“Hmm, I think I could manage that.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For a moment, I felt bad for him. Perhaps even a little guilty. I am the only person in his life who truly cares about him. And I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the long trail of zeros in his bank account and instantly recognizable last name. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>But it was only for a moment. It’s hard to feel bad for someone who has everything handed to them on a silver platter. I’m the one who deserves pity. I’d like to see him try to work two full time jobs while attending Columbia. I’d like to see him ride the subway for 2 hours every day. I don’t think he’s ever seen the inside of a subway, let alone get haggled by his mother for every hard-earned penny and nearly mugged on a weekly basis. I’d love to see him shove all of his classes back-to-back on Tuesdays and Thursdays, just so he can work non-stop the other five days of the week. I’d love to see him have to make an actual sacrifice. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“How about I take you out to dinner. We both have to eat right? I promise it’ll be quick.” Henri’s proposal was exactly what I intended of course--a luxurious and delicious (and most importantly, free) dinner somewhere in Midtown. The complete opposite of whatever Maria was concocting at home; something that would certainly have to be supplemented with Ramen. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>	“Yes, that would be lovely.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>“Maybe, if we’re quick, we might have time for a little dancing too.” 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>	I sigh dramatically, “My prince in shining armor, but whatever will I wear to the ball?” Who knows, maybe he’ll even throw in that shopping trip.  </p>
