      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>I'm Ariana Haghighi, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Cornell University. Outside of class, I tinker with robotics 
        and FPGA projects. Throughout the semester, I lead the Cornell Cup Robotics Electrical Subteam. 
        During Summer 2022, I worked at MITRE as an FPGA engineer. During Summer 2021, I worked at Astranis
        Space Technologies as a Digital Design Intern. 
        After graduating Cornell in May 2023, I am looking for a full time position as an FPGA Engineer.
