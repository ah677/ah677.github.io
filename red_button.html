									<h2>24 October 2021</h2>
                                    <p>I wrote this piece for my <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/ENGL/2800" target="_blank">Creative Writing class (ENGL 2800)</a>. This fictional piece aims to stretch out a split second of time over the course of a few pages.</p>

                                    <h2>The Red Button by Ariana Haghighi</h2>
                                    <p>“Execute,” the command hollered out of the speaker on the wall left me with little choice. A wall with a speaker, no microphone. This is not the time or place to ask questions. A single red button sits in front of me with only one course of action. We’ve trained for this scenario over and over again, but I never in my forty years thought I would need to act on that training. Yet, it’s just me in this small room, miles underground. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I have no choice: I must press the button. I am the only person authorized to do so. I am the only person with the power to act right now. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The rumors of war have haunted me for weeks now as the negotiations between Eastern People’s Union and the Western Republic have failed again and again. Stalemate over trade. Stalemate over territory on Ares. Stalemate over the dwindling resources on Earth. They seemed so far away; negotiations happening to politicians in New York, not to me. Yet, this button sits in front of me, not them. 
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I’ve never disobeyed an order before. Never even hesitated. Hesitation is the difference between life and death. If a commander tells you to move, you move. If he tells you to shoot, you shoot. The hierarchy is simple: listen to your superiors, execute your instructions, and give commands to your subordinates. There’s logic behind it, a sense of security. A command issued by the very top is always executed, no matter how far it must trickle down. And everyone is better for it. The people with the most experience and information make the decisions, and the people with the best skill and training execute those decisions. You need to have trust in order to survive. But this, this is different. A single missile, if aimed correctly, could kill millions. But one missile is always followed by another, and soon millions turn into billions. Are we really ready for this?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>It’s really a very ugly button. Poorly designed, lacking anything to make it more beautiful than it needs to be. A horrendous red knob randomly slapped in the middle of a cold, shiny aluminum desk. I wonder, if I press it, will my hand come away red?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>It’s not a question of ‘if,’ I must press it. Someone, somewhere has sent this command. Maybe the Republic has already been attacked. A major city? Have millions of civilians already died? Trillions of dollars of infrastructure permanently destroyed and land made useless for centuries by radiation? Anything could have happened since I swiped into the facility this morning. Or is this unprovoked? Why would the Union ever start something they know would end badly for everyone? The Cold War proved we could fight a war without resulting in something as drastic as nuclear weapons. But recognizing that would require the Union to have leaders with actual competency, something they’ve been lacking in for decades. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I list off treaty after treaty: a pact to stop refining uranium, an agreement to end nuclear testing, a pledge to protect the already wounded environment. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Unprovoked or not, the command is still here. The button begs for the warmth in my palm. If I wait a moment longer, will they fire me? Most certainly and with a dishonorable discharge. Banished from DC forever. If I let more than a second go by, will they send in someone else to execute the command? If I don’t do it, someone else certainly will. It’s not a question of if, but when. Maybe it’s a test. Maybe they want to make sure this old man is still paying attention to the training videos. Maybe they’ll even promote me if they think I’m loyal enough. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>No, this is real. I’ve seen the panic in my superior’s eyes these past weeks. I’ve seen the chaos on the news, the dazed politicians at crosswalks, the shortages at grocery stores. The war is here, whether we want it or not. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I wonder if there is another man, just like me, sitting somewhere deep underground in Moscow. He’s sitting in the same hard metal chair with a five o’clock shadow and a beer belly, thinking hard, staring at a button. But, his button is already pressed. Millions have already died because of him. No, not because of him, because someone told him to.
                                    </p>
									<p>If I press this button, will I tell myself that too? Will I tell myself that it isn’t my fault? Will my wife understand that it wasn’t me who killed millions? “I was just following orders.” Yeah, I’ve heard that one before. Will I, Chris Romulus, be held personally responsible for starting a nuclear war, my name memorized in textbooks forever? No, because if I don’t press this button, someone else will and at the expense of my job. Say it is a test, say it isn’t: the button gets pressed. My doubts rage inside of me, nearly ready to boil over, but trust is all we have. I must trust that someone thinks that this is the correct thing to do. Someone who knows more than me, has lived longer, seen more. They know. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>	I don’t let another moment of hesitation slip by: my hand descends on the button. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The wall finally acknowledges me: “Launch confirmed.” </p>
